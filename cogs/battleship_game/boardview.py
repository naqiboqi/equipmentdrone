"""
This module defines the `BoardView` class, a Discord UI View for managing ship placement on a board in a Battleship-style game. 
It allows players to interact with the board, move ships, rotate them, and confirm their placement via Discord's UI components 
like buttons and select menus.

### Dependencies:
- **`discord`**: Used for creating UI components and handling interactions.
- **`Board`**: Represents the game board and manages ship placements.
- **`Ship`**: Represents a ship with properties like size, position, and orientation.

Usage:
    This class is designed to be used as part of a Discord bot for a Battleship-style game. 
    It creates a visual and interactive ship placement interface for players, allowing them to select, move, 
    and rotate ships before starting the game.
