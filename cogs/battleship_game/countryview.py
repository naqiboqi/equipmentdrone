"""
This module contains the `CountryView` class, which allows players to select their country 
in a Battleship game through an interactive Discord UI. The view provides players with a list 
of available countries, and updates the game's state accordingly when a selection is made.

### Key Features:
- **Country Selection**:
    - Players can choose their country from a list using a dropdown menu.
    - The selected country is assigned to each player's profile, impacting the game state.
  
- **Interactive View**:
    - Uses `discord.ui.View` to create an interactive select dropdown for players to choose a country.
    - The selected country is displayed in the embed message, reflecting each player's choice.

- **Data Management**:
    - The module loads country names and associated ship names from a JSON file (`ship_names.json`).
    - The file is loaded into memory when the module is initialized, and any errors in loading are caught and logged.

### Classes:
- **`CountryView`**:
    A custom `discord.ui.View` that allows players to select a country, which is then stored in 
    the corresponding `Player` object. The view interacts with both players and updates the 
    embed message showing the countries each player has chosen.

### Dependencies:
- **`discord`**: For creating and managing the interactive Discord UI components like `discord.ui.View` and `discord.ui.Select`.
- **`json`**: For loading and parsing the `ship_names.json` file, which contains the available countries.
- **`os`**: For managing file paths and ensuring proper access to the `ship_names.json` file.
- **`player`**: Imports the `Player` class, which represents players in the game and stores their country choice.

### Constants:
- **`SHIP_JSON_PATH`**: Path to the JSON file that stores the available ship names and countries.
- **`SHIP_NAMES`**: Dictionary containing the countries loaded from the `ship_names.json` file.
