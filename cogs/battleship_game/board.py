"""
This module implements the classes and functionality for managing the game boards in a 
Battleship game. It includes classes for handling defensive and offensive boards, ship placement, 
attack processing, and board state validation.

### Key Features:
- **Board Representation**:
    - Separates defensive (ship placement) and offensive (attack tracking) boards for a 
      clear distinction of roles during gameplay.
    - Provides a structured grid-based representation for tracking game states.

- **Ship Placement**:
    - Ensures valid ship placement with checks for overlaps, boundaries, and adherence to game rules.
    - Offers a robust mechanism for placing ships strategically or programmatically.

- **Attack Handling**:
    - Processes attacks, updating offensive and defensive boards based on hits, misses, or sunk ships.
    - Tracks ongoing game progress and facilitates feedback on attack results.

- **State Validation**:
    - Validates board configurations for correctness.
    - Tracks remaining ships to determine game status and win conditions.

### Classes:
- **`Board`**:
    A base class providing shared functionality for managing a grid and validating actions.
- **`DefenseBoard`**:
    Represents a player's defensive board, managing ship placements and responding to attacks.
- **`AttackBoard`**:
    Represents a player's offensive board, tracking the results of attacks on the opponent's grid.

### Dependencies:
- **`discord`**: For creating and sending embeds and messages
- **`random`**: For generating randomized ship placements.
- **`typing`**: For type hints and annotations.
- **`ship`**: For placing and moving player ships.
