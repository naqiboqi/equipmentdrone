"""
This module implements a Battleship game cog for a Discord bot, designed to manage 
Battleship gameplay and user interaction within a server (guild). It utilizes the 
`discord.py` library to interact with Discord APIs, providing functionality for 
game setup, turn-based play, and result tracking.

### Key Features:
- **Game Logic**:
    - Handles the core Battleship gameplay, including ship placement, attack validation, 
      and turn progression.
    - Supports multiplayer games between human players or bots.
    - Manages game state tracking to ensure smooth play and turn order.

- **Discord Integration**:
    - Provides Discord commands for initiating games, making moves, and displaying game status.
    - Interactive bot messages to facilitate gameplay, ensuring players know whose turn it is 
      and the results of their actions.

- **Ship Placement**:
    - Validates player ship placements to ensure no overlap or invalid positions.
    - Allows players to strategically position their ships before the game starts.

- **Turn-based Play**:
    - Supports turn-based gameplay, allowing players to attack opponents' boards.
    - Validates and processes each attack to track hits, misses, and sunk ships.

- **Game State Management**:
    - Tracks ongoing game states and board configurations.
    - Provides embed updates and result displays to players via Discord.

### Classes:
- **`Game`**:
    Manages the core logic of the Battleship game, handling player turns, attack validation, 
    ship placements, and game state tracking.
- **`Battleship`**:
    A Discord cog integrating the game logic with Discord commands, enabling users to 
    start games, make moves, and view game results through bot interactions.

### Dependencies:
- **`discord`**: For interacting with Discord APIs and handling bot commands.
- **`random`**: For randomizing ship placement.
- **`re`**: For matching user input attack strings.
- **`asyncio`**: For sleep delays.
- **`battleship_game`**: Game
